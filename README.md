# FullStack

For this project I created a functioning web page with an SPA desgined for admin use using MEAN stack development. 
MongoDB was used for the database, Express.js and Node.js were used to complete the backend and Angular was used to develop the UI of the admin page. 
This project uses a combination of JSON, Javascript, Express HTML, and also utilizes bootstrap and handlebars.
In this class I learned how to utilize API endpoints in development, use multiple layers to create a secure webpage, and create a formal softare design document. 
I have no doubt that the skills learned in this class will be utilized frequently throughout my career.
